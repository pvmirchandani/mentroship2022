# Project Name: EcoNeighbors

## Problem Statement: 
In a world with growing environmental concerns ranging from biodiversity loss to pollution, encouraging sustainability is important. According to the WHO, air pollution kills over 7 million people per year, mostly due to outdoor pollutants and household exposure. This concern is not going away soon; air pollution along with other detrimental human actions are on the rise in most countries. However, small actions can make a difference. By encouraging people to be more environmentally conscious through small, everyday actions, we aim to fight against the aforementioned environmental concerns. That is why we propose: EcoNeighbors. 

## Proposed Solution: 

We propose EcoNeighbors, a Social Environmental App. As users join, they are connected with local environmental organizations and charities that share opportunities in the community. Our app presents the user with rewards as they log which activities and events they participate in, thus encouraging them to engage in activities. In the future, we look to expand our app by partnering with eco-friendly companies with regard to our reward system.
Target Audience: students looking for opportunities, organizations looking for volunteers, community citizens
