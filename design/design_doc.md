# Project Name: EcoNeighbors

## Problem Statement: 
In a world with growing environmental concerns ranging from biodiversity loss to pollution, encouraging sustainability is important. According to the WHO, air pollution kills over 7 million people per year, mostly due to outdoor pollutants and household exposure. This concern is not going away soon; air pollution along with other detrimental human actions are on the rise in most countries. However, small actions can make a difference. By encouraging people to be more environmentally conscious through small, everyday actions, we aim to fight against the aforementioned environmental concerns. That is why we propose: EcoNeighbors.
